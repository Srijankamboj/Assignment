# Monitor LinkedIn
This Python script uses Selenium to monitor a competitor's LinkedIn page for new connections. The script will first wait for the #new-connections element to be visible. If the element is visible, the script will then extract the information about each new connection, including the profile URL, name, company, and title. The script will then return a list of dictionaries containing this information.

Usage
To use the script, you will need to provide the URL of the competitor's LinkedIn page as a command-line argument. For example, to monitor the LinkedIn page for Acme Corporation, you would run the following command:

python monitor_linkedin.py https://www.linkedin.com/company/acme-corporation

The script will then start monitoring the page and will print a list of new connections to the console whenever a new connection is added.

Requirements
The script requires the following Python libraries:

Selenium
webdriver-manager
To install these libraries, you can run the following command:

pip install selenium webdriver-manager

To run the code use python monitor_linkedin.py
